# Smoke-detector-and-Alarm-Generator
1.Smoke detectors play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of people and properties by detecting smoke and alerting occupants to the presence of a potential fire. In the event of a fire, every second counts, and having a dependable smoke detector system can make all the difference in saving lives and minimizing damage.

# Features
• I had designed the Prototype which is simple, effective and efficient.
• Materials used: 9-volt battery,buzzer 9-volt battery clip photoresistor,light-dependent resistor (LDR),10K ohm resistor,small enclosure to house the detector Led lightsARDUINO/ESP32 GAS SENSOR KITJumper, wires Breadboard.

# Information
 Through the use of Arduino and gas sensors, I was able to create a reliable and accurate smoke detector that is responsive to different types of smoke and gas emissions. The system was able to detect the presence of smoke or gas in the environment and trigger an alarm to alert the user.Overall, my smoke detector project using Arduino and gas kit has great potential for use in homes, offices, and other public spaces. Its low cost and easy-to-use features make it an excellent solution for enhancing safety and preventing fires. I hope that this project will inspire further research and development in the field of smoke detector technology.
